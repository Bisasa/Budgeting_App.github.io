LITERATURE REVIEW
Money Dashboard
This an online financial budgeting application developed years ago, with the aim of
becoming a personal financial assistant for users. That is to say helping people take control
of their finances and empowering them to make the right financial decisions in life. The
application itself follows the approach of having one free version, which is platform
independent. There are several features including allowing the user to managing multiple
bank accounts online while viewing this financial information in visually representations
such as pie charts.
Advantages:
- Registration – The registration for the application is free both on utilization and
through a web browser with the only requirements of an email address and
password.
- Accessibility & Manageability – The application itself allows the user to have access
to managing several accounts in one place. This includes having the ability to
manage a variety of accounts types including savings accounts and loans even if
these are with different banking institutions.
- Functionality – Money dashboard offers several different options to users in financial
management and budgeting. The application itself has a budget planner feature,
which enables users to plan financial goals for the future or to control the amount
spending in relevant areas.
Disadvantages:
- Support - Money Dashboard is an application with read-only capability and therefore
only allowing the user to view financial information of accounts and not conduct
account transfers or payments.
Toshl
Toshl allows the user to “know their finances” and “worry less” in terms of saving money.
Toshl is a budgeting tool which allows the user to manage their expenses and income and
the developers suggest it is a “one stop budgeting tool for all”. The application developers
focus on the visualization of expenses allowing the users to know where their money is
going and to help them optimize their habits. The application allows the user to ascertain
trends based on their salary and spending and allows the user to forward plan as well. It also
has a reminder function to allow the user to remember to pay a bill and suggests that there
is a “fun side” to finances involving the apps own Toshl monsters.
Advantages:
- Multi Platform - Toshl not only works on your standard smartphone, it has support
for web applications and specific tablet applications as well. It syncs across devices
and as such offers an excellent cross platform experience. The fact that the interface 
is common across the application, means that the user spends less time recalling
how to use the application and instead, recognize the commonality quite quickly.
- User Interface - The application makes extensive use of pop ups and forms which are
elegantly designed with good symmetry applied to the design of each screen.
Related elements of the form are grouped well with each bit sectioned off by use of
lines and symbols. The visualization tools using line graphs and charts is easy to
understand showing the items on the left and the graph changing on the right. This
allows the user to digest the information more quickly and almost instantly.
- Monsters - Although the idea of small monsters aiding your finances is alien and
quite childish for some, their function in the application is quite novel. They are used
a guidance system for users through many tasks also providing sound financial
advice and offering quite a playful element to the application which is good for
younger adults who may use this application.
Disadvantages:
- Manually Entering Data - The application does not include a scan and save function
which means that the user must enter the information manually which means the
user must remember what they have bought and remember to input the data later.
In terms of memory and processing, this information is stored in the short term
memory, would decay quickly which means that transactions and logging of data
may be delayed or forgotten altogether.
- Limited App Functionality - Toshl comes into its element on the web application
offering rich user functionality and easily visualizing many items with ease. On the
application, however, this functionality can sometimes be constricted such as the
difficulty of viewing a line graph or chart on a small screen size. In order to make
best use of this application, you would have to use the application and the web
application together.
- Pro Version - Many of the applications advanced features such as household
budgeting by having individuals on a group account are hidden behind a pay wall.
Although the fee is marginal, it would put some users off. The free version only
allows a single budget or monthly income at one time.
Money Lover
Money Lover is personal financial budgeting applications, which can be used across several
devices. The purpose of the application allows its users to manage their personal finances,
make better financial decisions to plan for the future. As a mobile application Money lover is
available across multiple platforms with both a basic and premium service being available to
users.
Advantages:
- Privacy – Money lover operates as a standalone application where users are not
required to provide details of their accounts with banking institutions.
- Registration – The registration for the application is free to the user where only an
email address and password is requirement.
- Visuals – Money lover allows the user to visually see their financial state from how
they are managing their money. The application then uses this information to create
a visual representation of their management including visual graphs, charts and
statistics.
Disadvantages:
- Functionality – The application itself has both a basic and premium service to its
users. The premium service will enable users to experience no advertisements while
using the application. This may potential lead to users on the basic service becoming
frustrated when alerted with advertisements while trying to manage finances.
